### First Deployable MVP

Built and deployed the first static Azure MVP backed by Supabase.

Changed:

- Added Supabase email/password authentication.
- Added dashboard, tickets, workflows, customer actions, calendar, reports, and admin views.
- Added drag-and-drop ticket board.
- Added ticket creation with owner, customer, due date, priority, blocked reason, and readiness checks.
- Added New SOW Workflow starter.
- Added customer action register.
- Added Supabase migrations for operational workflow/accountability tables and ticket owner labels.
- Updated Azure Static Web Apps workflow to deploy static files without a build step.

Notes:

- AI is intentionally excluded from this MVP.
- Supabase email confirmation is currently enabled, so users must confirm email before sign-in unless that setting is changed.
